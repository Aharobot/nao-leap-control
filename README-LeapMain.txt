In order to have the LeapMain to work, run it as a main, and add a JVM variable java.library.path
according to your computer.

For example : -Djava.library.path=lib/x64

Of course you need a leap motion ;)

In order to have everything to work, you need to copy the leap motion libraries at the right places.
Unfortunately, it is forbidden to share these right now.
